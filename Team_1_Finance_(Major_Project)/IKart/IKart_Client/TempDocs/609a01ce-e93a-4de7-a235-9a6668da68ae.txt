Hema Sai, Sai, Satya, Lakshmi Shri, Sushmita. I put it in another group so you can expect some changes. Fine in this because Dinesh, I forgot to ask him. No, I will try to balance it. It's not that you will not do other thing you. It is only a preference. It's only your liking.
You prefer to do this fine, but you may you have to do everything. All of you, all of you will have to do all of it. So you will divide your responsibility after giving the case study. How I will do is what I will on the Monday morning before you write the test. I will freeze the teams and I will tell it to you final teams along with the.
Project case study and to one or two people from that particular group, I will send a mail. I will send a mail giving you the project case study so you all can brainstorm sitting together, connecting up with a teammate or anything.
And then finalize how you're going to go about your project, how you're going to go about your project right post lunch. Till such time you keep taking time. Maybe post lunch you can start off. I will also join you and you can start off for some time.
